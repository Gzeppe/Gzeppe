Hi, I’m Giuseppe 👋

I’m a software developer with a background in application configuration and backend-focused full-stack development. I build practical, data-driven applications and enjoy turning ideas into working systems that reflect real-world use cases.

### What I Work With
- Python & Django (models, views, ORM, authentication)
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- AWS (deployment, environment configuration)

### What I’m Focused On
I’m focused on backend and application-oriented roles where I can work on data-driven logic, system configuration, and scalable web applications. I value clean code, maintainability, and understanding how software supports real business requirements.

### Projects
Most of my repositories are hands-on projects built from concept to working application, with an emphasis on:
- Data modeling and relationships
- Business logic and configuration
- Backend architecture
- Practical tradeoffs and iteration

I continuously refine my projects and skills through building real systems — not just following tutorials.
