Hi, I’m Giuseppe 👋

I’m a software developer with a background in application configuration and full stack development. I enjoy turning ideas into working systems and building practical applications that reflect real-world use cases.

### What I Work With
- Python & Django (models, views, ORM, authentication)
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- AWS (deployment, environment configuration)

### What I’m Focused On
I’m especially interested in backend and application-focused roles where I can work on data-driven logic, system configuration, and scalable web applications. I value clean code, maintainability, and understanding how software supports real business needs.

### Projects
Most of my repositories are hands-on projects designed to go from concept to working application, with an emphasis on:
- Data modeling and relationships
- Business logic and configuration
- Backend architecture
- Practical tradeoffs and iteration

I’m always improving my projects and refining my skills through building, not just tutorials.
