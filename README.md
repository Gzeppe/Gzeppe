ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Giuseppe!
Iâ€™m a passionate self-taught developer who loves turning curiosity into code. I enjoy building clean, functional projectsâ€”even when theyâ€™re smallâ€”and I aim to achieve quality in my creations.

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what Iâ€™ve been working on:

ðŸ§  Majority of my experience is ultilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a growing love for Python

ðŸš€ Currently leveling up my back-end development skills by diving deeper into Python, implimenting the Django framework, and deploying the project on AWS

ðŸ›’ Next up: Planning on building an eCommerce website using Laravel and deploying it with AWS

Whether itâ€™s a small tutorial or a bigger challenge, I aim for quality and growth in everything I build.
