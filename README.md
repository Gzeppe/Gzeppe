Hi, I’m Giuseppe!
I’m a self-taught developer who enjoys learning and turning curiosity into code.

Here’s a snapshot of what I’ve been working on:

My experience is currently ultilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and actively leveling up my Python skills

My interests is in leveling up my back-end development skills by diving deeper into Python, implementing the Django framework, and deploying projects on AWS using postgres.

Eager to contribute to a team where clean code, continuous learning, and product impact are valued.
